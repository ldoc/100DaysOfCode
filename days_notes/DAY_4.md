# Day 4
## (11 January 2018)

* Today I will prepare the application to have a reponsive mark, maybe using CSS with media queries and flexbox. I will change the old demo components thinking already in do the final game app.

* I have to think how to implement component style too

* Today I have had problems with an issue between code splitting and HMR. I will continue tomorrow searching a solution because use HMR is important for development productivity
