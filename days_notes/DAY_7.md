# Day 7
## (14 January 2018 uploaded the next day)

* Today I have done a very simple structure for the PWA

* First of all remember to change the html viewport to avoid redimensions when use a mobile device:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

* The structure is based on the css-grid that allow me to define a grid that will change when the screen dimensions change
