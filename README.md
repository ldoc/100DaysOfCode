# 100DaysOfCode
## My first "100 days of code" challange

This challange is based on the official one: [100daysofcode](http://www.100daysofcode.com), but I have added some extra rule for me: 

* At least one hour and no more than two hours per day
* Make something concrete
* Have funÂ¡

Now you can check here my progress every day or you can follow me on twitter [@ldoc80](https://twitter.com/ldoc80)

## What Am I going to do?

Finally I have decided to do a game, an unusual kind of [Arkanoid](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid) 

And I want to go deeper into this web tech topics:

* PWA (Progressive Web Applications)
* React.js
* HTML5 WebAPIs (SVG, canvas, media)
* Maybe ... WebAssembly
